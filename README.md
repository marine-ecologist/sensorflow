## Full-Scale Acceleration Range

The full-scale acceleration range indicates the maximum and minimum values that the accelerometer can measure:

	•	±2 g: The accelerometer can measure acceleration from -2 g to +2 g (±19.62 m/s²)
	•	±4 g: The accelerometer can measure acceleration from -4 g to +4 g (±39.24 m/s²)
	•	±8 g: The accelerometer can measure acceleration from -8 g to +8 g (±58.86 m/s²)
	•	±16 g: The accelerometer can measure acceleration from -16 g to +16 g (±78.48 m/s²)

g (gravity) is the unit of acceleration due to gravity, approximately equal to 9.81 m/s². Therefore, in the ±2 g range, the accelerometer can measure accelerations up to about ±19.62 m/s².


## Angular Rate Range

The angular rate range indicates the maximum and minimum values that the gyroscope can measure:

	•	±125 dps: The gyroscope can measure angular velocities from -125 degrees per second to +125 degrees per second (dps)
	•	±250 dps: The gyroscope can measure angular velocities from -250 degrees per second to +250 degrees per second (dps)
	•	±500 dps: The gyroscope can measure angular velocities from -500 degrees per second to +500 degrees per second (dps)
	•	±1000 dps: The gyroscope can measure angular velocities from -1000 degrees per second to +1000 degrees per second (dps)
	•	±2000 dps: The gyroscope can measure angular velocities from -2000 degrees per second to +2000 degrees per second (dps)
